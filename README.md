An interactive learning platform from scratch for beginners and experts alike in the trading industry as my final term project for Fundamentals of Programming [15-112] at Carnegie Mellon in under 3 weeks.

This project consists of the following main parts:
- Indicators and graphs based on stock indicators written from scratch
- Simple linear regression/multiple linear regression machine learning models built from scratch [shallow learning, without use of sk-learn]
- Long short term memory model (LSTMM) deep learning RNN model built with Keras 

This stock simulation game helps users enforce good trading practices and provides a rough prediction of the trend of the desired stock trained on a selected data interval.


Themes:
- Helping users understand best practices
- Writing technical analysis indicators as well as shallow machine learning algorithms from scratch
- Utilizing cutting-edge deep learning models (LSTMM) to predict stock data
